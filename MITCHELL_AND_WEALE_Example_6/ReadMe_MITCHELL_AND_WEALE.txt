Steps to reproduce Example 6
------
1. Run Example6.py. The script generates a figure of the expected score differences, saved in the Figures directory, and prints the alpha-root of the expected score differences.


Other remarks
------ 
In case no TeX distribution is available, replace True by False in rc('text', usetex=True).
